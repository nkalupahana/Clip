# Clip

Clip is a menu bar app that maintains a record of the last 30 seconds (by default) of everything it's heard from your mic. 
If you click on the icon, it'll "clip" those last few seconds into an audio file. I made this because my suitemates are full
of great one-liners and I wanted a way to remember them. However, this app has all sorts of other useful applications, from having
a quick way to record harassment and uncomfortable encounters as they happen, to being able to capture meeting highlights in 
a distraction-free way.

Obviously, there are some serious privacy implications for this app, and some potential for abuse. Please exercise caution. All data processing is done locally, and no web requests are ever made, as can be seen from the application source. If you are recording others, ensure you have their consent, or that you are in a place with single-party consent laws for recording. The use of this application is also strictly licensed to prevent malicious actors from using it for harm. Please review the license to ensure you are in compliance.

## Installation

You can also build the app directly on Xcode.
