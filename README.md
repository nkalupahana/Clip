# Clip

Clip is a menu bar app that maintains a record of the last 30 seconds (by default) of everything it's heard from your mic. 
If you click on the icon, it'll "clip" those last few seconds into an audio file. I made this because my suitemates are full
of great one-liners and I wanted a way to remember them. However, this app has all sorts of other useful applications, from having
a quick way to record harassment and uncomfortable encounters as they happen, to being able to capture meeting highlights in 
a distraction-free way.

## Installation

Download the latest zip of the `.app` from [releases](https://github.com/nkalupahana/Clip/releases). 
You can also build the app directly on Xcode.

## Usage

- Click the menu bar app to clip a recording.
- Right-click the menu bar app to access preferences, or to quit the app.
